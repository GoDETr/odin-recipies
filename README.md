Its 20th of September. I feel kind of lonely but not really. 
We got a week full of holidays. Should I have gone home and enjoyed my holidays.
Or should I study and do other shit.
I don't even know what I want in life now. While the college was running, I was caugnt on chasing it, trapped in its speed and pacing. When they stopped I had to see where I was left standing, I am far from where I started. There is no way I can stop now, only way I know is forward. But, is that the way im meant to follow. What do I really want to do. When will I find that out again? 
I hope nothing bad happens. Please take care of yourself.
